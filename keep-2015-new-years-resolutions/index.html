                    <p>2015 is here, and it&#8217;s time to talk 2015 New Years Resolutions. This is a time when the world makes promises to do countless acts of self-improvements. There is no doubt that this activity makes the world a better place, which is why I&#8217;m writing a blog post about it. But making sure a New Years Resolution is successful is another story. In this article I will share an awesome strategy for making sure your resolutions are successful, as well as sharing what my personal goals are for this year.</p>
<h1>Strategies for Making Resolutions</h1>
<p>Strategies you say? Yes. Writing down your resolutions is easy, but making sure you can measure your achievements is where the strategy comes into play. Don&#8217;t worry! It&#8217;s super simple.</p>
<p>The 4 strategies I discovered are actually from the Youtube magician/lifehacker/overall cool guy <a href="https://twitter.com/shwood" target="_blank">Brian Brushwood</a>. He had a Youtube video, comically titled, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsXI-XJRuA" target="_blank">Why Resolutions are DUMB</a>.  Here are the 4 strategies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Write them down!</strong></p>
<p>This is a &#8220;special gift&#8221; that only successful people have figured out. And that gift is the power of the written goal. Post them where you can see them everyday. Print out 3 of them. One in the office. One in the mirror in the bathroom. One in the shower (that&#8217;s the time your brain is in &#8220;screensaver&#8221; mode).</p>
<p><strong>2. Be specific</strong></p>
<p>Clear on what yor&#8217;re doing hit a targaet number. mae them wualitificatlbe. Needs to be easuy to seee.</p>
<p><strong>3. Must have a deadline.</strong></p>
<p>This is easy. New Years Resolutions have a built in deadline! Everything has got to be achieved by December 31, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write multiple goals.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t obsess over one single goal. Make 10 goals.  And cover a long range of topics. Health, fitness, relationships, financial, career goals, etc. Maybe you&#8217;re a students who wants to achieve certain grade point averages.</p>
<h1>My Personal New Years Resolutions</h1>
<p>In no particular order, but I did group them in 3 categories (personal/job/social).</p>
<p><strong>1. Get Perfect Teeth (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: This is simple. Just wear my Invisalign and go to my scheduled appointments!</p>
<p>My teeth are not perfect. You would never know this from seeing me in pictures, because (fortunately) my four front teeth looked straight. Those are the only teeth I&#8217;d show in pictures. But on the sides of my front teeth, it is a different story. They are not aligned and lead to cross/overbites in each tooth. As for my bottom teeth, they are very crowded.</p>
<p>I started noticing this more and more the last two years, perhaps it&#8217;s because my wisdom teeth were crowding. Or perhaps it was because I was becoming more aware of the problem. Either way, the designer in me wanted perfection, even when it comes to how straight my teeth are! There were some things I had to get done before I get orthodontia.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>The designer in me wanted perfection, even when it comes to how straight my teeth are!</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t write down my goals in 2014, I planned for what was to come in 2015. I got a new dentist, where I had three cleanings. Most importantly, he took pictures and gave me a complete consultation on what it would take to have a perfect smile. Mid 2014, I got consultations on wisdom teeth extraction, baby tooth extraction (yes I still had a baby tooth), and Invisalign appointments. I&#8217;m happy to say I already got the wisdom teeth/baby tooth extracted, and have gotten my first two trays of Invisalign! 2015 is going to be as simple as wearing them!</p>
<p><strong>2. Stay on Top of My Photography (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Every photoshoot I take with my camera I will immediate save to my computer and import into Adobe Lightroom. Use the folder structure of Year &gt; Shoot name &gt; Any Subgroup. I will use the built in Facebook and Flickr tools to upload to social networks throughout 2015. Every photoshoot I go on, I will geotag with an iPhone app to save my time and sanity.</p>
<p>In 2014, I bought a Canon 5D and traveled to Europe. I took over 7,000 photos there. Unfortunately, I edited and posted only a dozen. That is really bad. So I spent the end of 2014 prepping with Adobe Lightroom Tutorials and learning better ways to manage my photos. I made some mistakes along the way of traveling, such as not using an app to geotag my photos. I found there are easy ways to do this, including this one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp1KCkItmf4" target="_blank">DigitalRev TV&#8217;s Youtube Channel</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Start a Real Business (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Make a decision on what idea I want to pursue and create at least the design mockup.</p>
<p>I have 3-4 ideas that have been floating in my head for a long time. I used this website design process as a dry run. I now know how to use Github, know that I will be using Sketch instead of Photoshop, as well as discovering what I should and shouldn&#8217;t stress about. I also discovered some great tutorial sites, such as <a href="https://designcode.io/" target="_blank">DesignCode.io</a> that will help me through the process. 2015 is the year I make things happen!</p>
<p><strong>4. Start Lifting Weights Again (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Lift 4 days a week. Run 2.</p>
<p>This goes without explanation, lifting weight is healthy. I got into a routine in 2014 of running 2-3 times a week to build stamina. I also ate healthy by cooking on my own and juicing. But I really want to gain mass. I used to lift quite often 2 years ago. And I want to get back on track. I really should be setting specific weight goals/dimension changes, but that will come at the micro level, not in this resolution list.</p>
<p><strong>5. Work Smarter, Not Harder (JOB)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Share every design with <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InvisionApp</a>. Use <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> for all design mockups.</p>
<p>I realize now that being stuck in an old routines was making me work hard. So many designers are switching from Photoshop to Sketch to solve that issue. I used Sketch towards the end of 2014 and completely fell in love. And sharing with InvisionApp REALLY makes sharing faster.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk With My Older Brother More (SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: I set a reminder on my calendar to give my older brother a call once a month on the 15th. Any more than once a month is fine, and will probably lead to us hanging out more in person.</p>
<p>When I was younger, me and my two brothers would do so much together. But as we get older, I became closer to my younger brother, and seemingly more distant from my older brother. Teenage adolescent arguments led to this seperation. But life is short and this one needs to be rectified.</p>
<p><strong>7. Become More Social Network Engaged (SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Post at least once a week on social networks.</p>
<p>I really need to post more design related things to become a bigger member of the design community. Sometimes, when I register for an event, such as <a href="http://2015.leanuxnyc.co/" target="_blank">LeanUX NYC</a> (which I am attending in 2015), they ask for my Twitter handle. This is embarrassing, because my Twitter was not used in a while, and was no longer linked to my other accounts. My Flickr wasn&#8217;t being used. And in general I was barely posting. I&#8217;ve since fixed all of those issues. Now the only thing holding me back is sharing interesting things in my life, and there are plenty of those!</p>
<p><strong>8. Wardrobe (PERSONAL/WORK/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Buy 3 good pants/shirts/shoes/accessories. Intermix them and create cool combinations. Get inpiration from blogs and store websites to see outfits.</p>
<p>I love wearing dress clothes. I feel so comfortable and confident in them. This might seem strange to a lot of people, especially here in San Diego. A lot of people prefer t-shirts and flip flops as much as possible. I like that on the weekends, but for work, I want to do something more.</p>
<p>Ever since I stopped working for a bank, my dress restrictions for work have gotten a bit relaxed. It&#8217;s always been &#8220;business casual&#8221; for me the last couple years. So my routine is just wearing some jeans, an untucked collared shirt, and some casual looking skate brand shoes. This is a far departure from what I was used to at the bank. Having come in handy for social events.</p>
<p><strong>9. Wake Up Earlier (PERSONAL/JOB/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Set my recurring iPhone alarms for an ultimate wakeup of 7:30. This means setting an alarm at 11:30 every night to feel well rested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in a bad routine the last couple years of staying up late. I want to get to work before everyone else. This is ease pressure to get things done because I won&#8217;t be rushing, it will allow me to leave earlier, and ultimately it will make me look like a better employee. Think Woody Allen&#8217;s famous quote, &#8220;Most of life is simply showing up.&#8221; On top of all that, I feel like a million bucks in the morning when I&#8217;m early and well rested.</p>
<p><strong>10. Write More (PERSONAL/JOB/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: At least one blog post a month</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like having to spend so much time refining my emails to get them to be perfect. I want them to be well structured right off the bat. I&#8217;m going to start analyzing other great bloggers, like <a href="http://www.misshattan.com/jaguar-london-xe-reveal" target="_blank">Misshattan</a>, and see their &#8220;short and simple&#8221; methodologies when they write a blog post.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>With these strategies. you&#8217;ll FIND ways to make all your New Years Resolutions happen. And as Brain Brushwood points out, it&#8217;s OK if you don&#8217;t achieve your goals! You&#8217;re probably way farther ahead and closer to them if you didn&#8217;t write them down!</p>
<p>At one time, I could careless about resolutions. I use to say to myself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need New Years Resolutions. If I need to change, I do so anytime I want.&#8221; I realize now that setting goals for the New Year helps to segment your life into proper modules of time (years). Doing this &#8220;anytime&#8221; will just tire you out. Doing it at the start of the year creates deadlines and allows rest periods.</p>
<p>What are your 2015 New Years Resolutions? Let me know in the comments!</p>
