				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 2016 upon us, everyone is posting their 2016 New Years Resolutions.  I strongly believe in setting goals, which is why I&#8217;m referring to this post as &#8220;goals&#8221; and not &#8220;resolutions.&#8221; A &#8220;resolution&#8221; is a firm decision to do or not to do something, which is wrong, because it doesn&#8217;t allow room to change strategies mid-year, which is bound to happen, things don&#8217;t always go as a planned. A &#8220;goal&#8221; is a personal ambition or effort with a desired result, which is much more inline with my way of thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at. -Bruce Lee</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I believe this is so important? I want to give myself parameters so I stay focused and prioritized.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing it a little different this year, by keeping the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">S.M.A.R.T. acronym goal system</a>. This will help ensure my goals are actually achieved. Also, I&#8217;ll added checkpoints in on Google Calendar to make sure things stay on course.</p>
<figure id="attachment_341" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_341" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/010116-2016-new-years-google-calendar.jpg"><img class="wp-image-341 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/010116-2016-new-years-google-calendar.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_341" class="wp-caption-text">Notice the Purple Calendar I create titled &#8220;2016 Goal Track&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are my New Years Goals for 2016…</p>
<h1>Personal</h1>
<ol>
<li>Work out 3x a week starting immediately (On Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Continue building wardrobe by March (On Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Rent current property and make residual income for the first time in my life sometime in April (TBD)</li>
<li>Purchase a second place &#8211; condo downtown or house sometime in April (TBD)</li>
<li>Travel to at least a new destination &#8211; Asia, Eastern Europe, or South America by May (planning on Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Play at least 3 new songs on Piano by end of year (On Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Blog travel journeys starting with my first trip sometime in May (TBD)</li>
<li>Continue interior design of my bedroom &amp; living room sometime in September (TBD)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Career</h1>
<ol>
<li>Limit Freelance Projects to none &#8211; wrap up Platinum Wing &amp; Ana Miranda Fitness as soon as possible by January (Time allocated on Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Create one app from scratch and submit to app store by May (TBD)</li>
<li>Become more seasoned Senior UX Designer at work by creating a brand creation methodology at Illumina by June (TBD)</li>
<li>Upload current work to <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a> and <a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/" target="_blank">Personal Website</a> by June (TBD)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Relationships</h1>
<ol>
<li>Talk to family twice a month immediately (On Google Calendar)</li>
<li>Use holidays as a way for couples at least one month before each holiday (TBD)</li>
</ol>
<p>As I wrote this list, I realized how much I am going to set out to do this year.There are so many details I want to get into on each of them, but I will determine those when I begin, and maybe use those for future blog posts. I will place check-in points at the end of each quarter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind flexibility is key here, and things will change and be removed and updated from this list.</p>
<p>What are your New Year&#8217;s Goals? Let me know in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the start of last year, I had no freaking idea what the hell &#8220;Github&#8221; was. Words like &#8220;repository&#8221; and &#8220;source control&#8221; were foreign to me, and I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it. In this article, I&#8217;ll help you understand Github, in a way you&#8217;ve never heard before.</p>
<h2>So really, what the hell is Github?</h2>
<p>I wish someone broke it down like I am today, so listen up. At it&#8217;s most basic level, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> is free cloud storage. Yep, that&#8217;s it in a nutshell. Hardcore coders would get mad at me right about now, because Github can do a whole lot more than that. It also helps you keep track of your changes, and manage code changes between your team. Let me break those three things down in more detail.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>At it&#8217;s most basic level, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> is free cloud storage. Yep, that&#8217;s it in a nutshell.</h3>
</blockquote>
<h2>1. Cloud storage</h2>
<p>When you sign up for Github, you will create your first &#8220;repository.&#8221; This is nothing more than a folder in the cloud, hosted on Github servers.</p>
<p>You can make changes to this code on Github&#8217;s actual website, but you want to use a real text editor like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a>. So instead, download the free <a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">Github for Mac</a> application. You&#8217;ll clone that &#8220;repository&#8221; to any location on your computer. I like to keep my repositories in a folder on the desktop titled &#8220;Github,&#8221; for easy access.</p>
<p>At this point, you could theoretically put anything you want in that &#8220;repository&#8217;s&#8221; folder, including PSDs, but it is geared for code files like HTML and CSS. What ever changes you make to the files (including deleting, renaming, adding) will be tracked, which takes us to feature number two.</p>
<h2>2. Keeping track of your changes</h2>
<p>As I said earlier, you&#8217;ll want to have a desktop application, like Github for Mac, to track your changes. If not, you&#8217;ll have to push it with code, which sounds boring and sucks! I&#8217;m going to use the analogy of a gun for these purposes. Please, don&#8217;t get political about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Load the magazine / Pressing save</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every time you change a line of code and press &#8220;save,&#8221; it is tracked, or put in the magazine. This happens in the background, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2. Cock the gun / Commuting your changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can periodically &#8220;commit&#8221; those changes in the Github for Mac App, which basically loads the gun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3. Fire / Pushing your changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can &#8220;push&#8221; or &#8220;sync&#8221; your changes, which puts them up in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cool thing is you can always revert back changes again and again, in case you mess up.</p>
<h2>3. Team management</h2>
<p>Because you&#8217;re working off the cloud, everyone always has the latest copy of the website &#8220;cloned&#8221; on their MacBooks. It doesn&#8217;t happen automatically, which is why, periodically, they need to &#8220;pull&#8221; / &#8220;sync&#8221; their files. It&#8217;s good practice to do this every morning before you start working.</p>
<p>Adding your coworker&#8217;s code to yours is simple. But what if your coworker deletes some of your code? No worries. The Github app will help manage code discrepancies.</p>
<h2>There are Github alternatives</h2>
<p>The problem with Github is that you &#8220;repositories&#8221; are public. They are freely searchable, and indexed by Google. You <em>can</em> pay for private &#8220;repositories,&#8221; but why would you? <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> is a competitor to Github, and it gives you free private repositories. I&#8217;ll cover Bitbucket in a future blog post.</p>
<p>That being said, start with Github, it&#8217;s the most popular. I&#8217;d start with that, get the hang of it, and progress onto others. I hope I&#8217;ve given you the lowdown of the basic of Github. Let me know what you think in the comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2015 is here, and it&#8217;s time to talk 2015 New Years Resolutions. This is a time when the world makes promises to do countless acts of self-improvements. There is no doubt that this activity makes the world a better place, which is why I&#8217;m writing a blog post about it. But making sure a New Years Resolution is successful is another story. In this article I will share an awesome strategy for making sure your resolutions are successful, as well as sharing what my personal goals are for this year.</p>
<h1>Strategies for Making Resolutions</h1>
<p>Strategies you say? Yes. Writing down your resolutions is easy, but making sure you can measure your achievements is where the strategy comes into play. Don&#8217;t worry! It&#8217;s super simple.</p>
<p>The 4 strategies I discovered are actually from the Youtube magician/lifehacker/overall cool guy <a href="https://twitter.com/shwood" target="_blank">Brian Brushwood</a>. He had a Youtube video, comically titled, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsXI-XJRuA" target="_blank">Why Resolutions are DUMB</a>.  Here are the 4 strategies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Write them down!</strong></p>
<p>This is a &#8220;special gift&#8221; that only successful people have figured out. And that gift is the power of the written goal. Post them where you can see them everyday. Print out 3 of them. One in the office. One in the mirror in the bathroom. One in the shower (that&#8217;s the time your brain is in &#8220;screensaver&#8221; mode).</p>
<p><strong>2. Be specific</strong></p>
<p>Clear on what yor&#8217;re doing hit a targaet number. mae them wualitificatlbe. Needs to be easuy to seee.</p>
<p><strong>3. Must have a deadline.</strong></p>
<p>This is easy. New Years Resolutions have a built in deadline! Everything has got to be achieved by December 31, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write multiple goals.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t obsess over one single goal. Make 10 goals.  And cover a long range of topics. Health, fitness, relationships, financial, career goals, etc. Maybe you&#8217;re a students who wants to achieve certain grade point averages.</p>
<h1>My Personal New Years Resolutions</h1>
<p>In no particular order, but I did group them in 3 categories (personal/job/social).</p>
<p><strong>1. Get Perfect Teeth (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: This is simple. Just wear my Invisalign and go to my scheduled appointments!</p>
<p>My teeth are not perfect. You would never know this from seeing me in pictures, because (fortunately) my four front teeth looked straight. Those are the only teeth I&#8217;d show in pictures. But on the sides of my front teeth, it is a different story. They are not aligned and lead to cross/overbites in each tooth. As for my bottom teeth, they are very crowded.</p>
<p>I started noticing this more and more the last two years, perhaps it&#8217;s because my wisdom teeth were crowding. Or perhaps it was because I was becoming more aware of the problem. Either way, the designer in me wanted perfection, even when it comes to how straight my teeth are! There were some things I had to get done before I get orthodontia.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>The designer in me wanted perfection, even when it comes to how straight my teeth are!</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t write down my goals in 2014, I planned for what was to come in 2015. I got a new dentist, where I had three cleanings. Most importantly, he took pictures and gave me a complete consultation on what it would take to have a perfect smile. Mid 2014, I got consultations on wisdom teeth extraction, baby tooth extraction (yes I still had a baby tooth), and Invisalign appointments. I&#8217;m happy to say I already got the wisdom teeth/baby tooth extracted, and have gotten my first two trays of Invisalign! 2015 is going to be as simple as wearing them!</p>
<p><strong>2. Stay on Top of My Photography (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Every photoshoot I take with my camera I will immediate save to my computer and import into Adobe Lightroom. Use the folder structure of Year &gt; Shoot name &gt; Any Subgroup. I will use the built in Facebook and Flickr tools to upload to social networks throughout 2015. Every photoshoot I go on, I will geotag with an iPhone app to save my time and sanity.</p>
<p>In 2014, I bought a Canon 5D and traveled to Europe. I took over 7,000 photos there. Unfortunately, I edited and posted only a dozen. That is really bad. So I spent the end of 2014 prepping with Adobe Lightroom Tutorials and learning better ways to manage my photos. I made some mistakes along the way of traveling, such as not using an app to geotag my photos. I found there are easy ways to do this, including this one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp1KCkItmf4" target="_blank">DigitalRev TV&#8217;s Youtube Channel</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Start a Real Business (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Make a decision on what idea I want to pursue and create at least the design mockup.</p>
<p>I have 3-4 ideas that have been floating in my head for a long time. I used this website design process as a dry run. I now know how to use Github, know that I will be using Sketch instead of Photoshop, as well as discovering what I should and shouldn&#8217;t stress about. I also discovered some great tutorial sites, such as <a href="https://designcode.io/" target="_blank">DesignCode.io</a> that will help me through the process. 2015 is the year I make things happen!</p>
<p><strong>4. Start Lifting Weights Again (PERSONAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Lift 4 days a week. Run 2.</p>
<p>This goes without explanation, lifting weight is healthy. I got into a routine in 2014 of running 2-3 times a week to build stamina. I also ate healthy by cooking on my own and juicing. But I really want to gain mass. I used to lift quite often 2 years ago. And I want to get back on track. I really should be setting specific weight goals/dimension changes, but that will come at the micro level, not in this resolution list.</p>
<p><strong>5. Work Smarter, Not Harder (JOB)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Share every design with <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InvisionApp</a>. Use <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> for all design mockups.</p>
<p>I realize now that being stuck in an old routines was making me work hard. So many designers are switching from Photoshop to Sketch to solve that issue. I used Sketch towards the end of 2014 and completely fell in love. And sharing with InvisionApp REALLY makes sharing faster.</p>
<p><strong>6. Talk With My Older Brother More (SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: I set a reminder on my calendar to give my older brother a call once a month on the 15th. Any more than once a month is fine, and will probably lead to us hanging out more in person.</p>
<p>When I was younger, me and my two brothers would do so much together. But as we get older, I became closer to my younger brother, and seemingly more distant from my older brother. Teenage adolescent arguments led to this seperation. But life is short and this one needs to be rectified.</p>
<p><strong>7. Become More Social Network Engaged (SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Post at least once a week on social networks.</p>
<p>I really need to post more design related things to become a bigger member of the design community. Sometimes, when I register for an event, such as <a href="http://2015.leanuxnyc.co/" target="_blank">LeanUX NYC</a> (which I am attending in 2015), they ask for my Twitter handle. This is embarrassing, because my Twitter was not used in a while, and was no longer linked to my other accounts. My Flickr wasn&#8217;t being used. And in general I was barely posting. I&#8217;ve since fixed all of those issues. Now the only thing holding me back is sharing interesting things in my life, and there are plenty of those!</p>
<p><strong>8. Wardrobe (PERSONAL/WORK/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Buy 3 good pants/shirts/shoes/accessories. Intermix them and create cool combinations. Get inpiration from blogs and store websites to see outfits.</p>
<p>I love wearing dress clothes. I feel so comfortable and confident in them. This might seem strange to a lot of people, especially here in San Diego. A lot of people prefer t-shirts and flip flops as much as possible. I like that on the weekends, but for work, I want to do something more.</p>
<p>Ever since I stopped working for a bank, my dress restrictions for work have gotten a bit relaxed. It&#8217;s always been &#8220;business casual&#8221; for me the last couple years. So my routine is just wearing some jeans, an untucked collared shirt, and some casual looking skate brand shoes. This is a far departure from what I was used to at the bank. Having come in handy for social events.</p>
<p><strong>9. Wake Up Earlier (PERSONAL/JOB/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: Set my recurring iPhone alarms for an ultimate wakeup of 7:30. This means setting an alarm at 11:30 every night to feel well rested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in a bad routine the last couple years of staying up late. I want to get to work before everyone else. This is ease pressure to get things done because I won&#8217;t be rushing, it will allow me to leave earlier, and ultimately it will make me look like a better employee. Think Woody Allen&#8217;s famous quote, &#8220;Most of life is simply showing up.&#8221; On top of all that, I feel like a million bucks in the morning when I&#8217;m early and well rested.</p>
<p><strong>10. Write More (PERSONAL/JOB/SOCIAL)</strong></p>
<p>Quantify: At least one blog post a month</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like having to spend so much time refining my emails to get them to be perfect. I want them to be well structured right off the bat. I&#8217;m going to start analyzing other great bloggers, like <a href="http://www.misshattan.com/jaguar-london-xe-reveal" target="_blank">Misshattan</a>, and see their &#8220;short and simple&#8221; methodologies when they write a blog post.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>With these strategies. you&#8217;ll FIND ways to make all your New Years Resolutions happen. And as Brain Brushwood points out, it&#8217;s OK if you don&#8217;t achieve your goals! You&#8217;re probably way farther ahead and closer to them if you didn&#8217;t write them down!</p>
<p>At one time, I could careless about resolutions. I use to say to myself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need New Years Resolutions. If I need to change, I do so anytime I want.&#8221; I realize now that setting goals for the New Year helps to segment your life into proper modules of time (years). Doing this &#8220;anytime&#8221; will just tire you out. Doing it at the start of the year creates deadlines and allows rest periods.</p>
<p>What are your 2015 New Years Resolutions? Let me know in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has recently been pushing their <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Material Design</a> across all platforms, even iOS. About a month ago, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank">Google Maps for iOS</a> was revised with the brand new Material Design look and feel. As a designer, I thought, &#8220;this is great.&#8221; The folks at Google really push design as part a competitive advantage over Apple&#8217;s UI that was introduced with iOS 7. But after using it, it dawned on me that their was a major usability problem lurking inside.</p>
<h1>The Changes</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take a look at the structure and design of the old Google Maps and compare it to the new one. Google introduced new principles. These <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles" target="_blank">principles</a> that Google incorporated from their Material Design language are: material is a metaphor (a metaphor for paper and ink), bold, graphic, intentional (like print based design which focuses on typography and white space), and motion provides meaning (making animations that don&#8217;t disrupt but aid).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Material Design documentation, Google handles primary actions with two main methods: &#8220;Floating Actions&#8221; and &#8220;Toolbars.&#8221; Now, starting navigation is something I would, and many others would consider a primary action. So I would expect it to be one of the two. But as you will find out, it&#8217;s neither.</p>
<h1>The Usability Problem</h1>
<p>As a user, the main thing I want to do when using a navigation app on my iPhone is to get to where I need to go, as soon as possible. This entails pressing the &#8220;start navigation&#8221; button. One problem: I could not find it. For the life of me. I stared at my phone for a good minute, trying to figure out where to tap to begin navigation. There was no floating button. There was no button in the toolbar. And I&#8217;m a UX Designer for crying out loud!</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only person to have this usability problem. The next day, I was in the car with my brother, only to discover he also could not find this call to action. Eventually, my brother figured it out. But the point of UX Design is to make things faster and easier to use.</p>
<p>It turns out that the way to start navigation is by tapping regular text, not a button. It completely gets lost in the list with all the other items.</p>
<figure id="attachment_242" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_242" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/material-design-iphone.jpg"><img class="wp-image-242 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/material-design-iphone.jpg" alt="material-design-iphone" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_242" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Start Navigation&#8221; is a primary action but doesn&#8217;t follow Google Material&#8217;s rules about primary actions </figcaption></figure>
<h1>My Point</h1>
<p>The point I am trying to make here centers around all the fact that no user interface has a perfect structure. The problem is UI/UX designers automatically make the assumption that what Google has is exactly what they should be doing. Just looking at the level of detail on Google&#8217;s Material Design website, even I am just amazed by the level of detail.</p>
<p>But understand that all user interfaces have flaws. Google&#8217;s Material is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but don&#8217;t feel like it steps on your what you are doing. Just because you don&#8217;t go into depth about animations velocity that you have an inferior design.</p>
<figure id="attachment_241" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_241" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-material-animation.jpg"><img class="wp-image-241 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-material-animation.jpg" alt="google-material-animation" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_241" class="wp-caption-text">A super in-depth page about animations in Material Design</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, everyone has their own UX and design methodology. For me, I always try to emulate the best, but my own creativity might be suffering if I do it too much. Solving problems that might even be better than what a Google designer can come up with. What do you think? Leave me a comment below and let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is always odd to me when you ask a designer if they have a personal website and they say &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;I used to but it&#8217;s old.&#8221; So back in 2010, I designed a website for myself. Partially because I didn&#8217;t want to be <em>that</em> designer who says they don&#8217;t have a site. Partially, because I had to make portfolio site for a class I was taking at San Diego State University. I produced a website that was good for the time. Fast forward four years later, and it is truly old and outdated. Here are the reasons why all designers should have their own website.</p>
<h1>You challenge Yourself</h1>
<p>So why not just use a theme? Photoshop templates are readily online. Take it a step further, and Bootstrap templates are available online. If time is an issue, then themes are fine. If you really want to learn new things, don&#8217;t rely on themes, you really have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>For my site, I set pretty high expectations. I wanted a filterable portfolio, Flickr feed, Instagram Feed, Twitter feed, fancy embellishments like Google Maps, and a blog! This meant I&#8217;d have to do a WordPress conversion when the design was done, adding another 2 months on to my time line. But I had this time to spare. I wasn&#8217;t in a rush.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>If you really want to learn new things, don&#8217;t rely on themes, you really have to do it yourself.</h1>
</blockquote>
<h1>You learn the latest web technologies</h1>
<p>In order to throughrouly learn technologies like HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and WordPress 4 (all of which I used for <a href="http://www.iamkevinrhodes.com" target="_blank">iamKevinRhodes.com</a>), you need to use them extensively. This was my way of &#8220;forcing&#8221; myself to learn.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a great way to learn new tools. I learned so much with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3</a>, <a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">Github for Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/" target="_blank">MAMP Pro</a>, and <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>. I also found that <a href="http://dploy.io/" target="_blank">dploy.io</a> is an awesome way to make your site go live with an FTP client like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>.</p>
<h1>You gather design resources</h1>
<p>I thoroughly explored websites like <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Wrapbootstrap</a> and <a href="http://themeforest.net/" target="_blank">Themeforest</a> and started cataloging all the great design sources I saw. For isntance, a theme might have awesome typogrpahy that I will use for a later project. I also got ideas from <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a>.</p>
<p>I took note of the resources by copying their links into a notebook I created in <a href="http://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank">OneNote</a> (just a  sidenote, I plan on creating a blog post in the near future on how I catalog design resources).</p>
<h1>You&#8217;ll be ready for that next job</h1>
<p>If you&#8217;re a designer looking for employment, a personal website is a must. But scrambling to build one after being laid off is no good. You should always be ready for anything life throws at you. Depending on the amount of time you have, you can just use a well designed theme. It doens&#8217;t have to be as extensive as mine.</p>
<h1>In Closing</h1>
<p>I hope I gave you some motivational reason why you should have your own site. I&#8217;m really proud of mine, and will be submitting it to Behance, <a href="http://onepagelove.com/" target="_blank">OnePageLove.com</a>, <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards.com</a>, <a href="http://builtwithbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">BuiltWithBootstrap.com</a>, and trying to get a Dribble invitation on <a href="http://draft.im/" target="_blank">Draft.im</a>.</p>
<p>It will be super assuring to be at a conference, or in a room with other designers and actively give out my web URL. What&#8217;s your motivation for creating your site? Let me know in the comments below.</p>
