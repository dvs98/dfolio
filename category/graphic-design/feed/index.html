				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has recently been pushing their <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Material Design</a> across all platforms, even iOS. About a month ago, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank">Google Maps for iOS</a> was revised with the brand new Material Design look and feel. As a designer, I thought, &#8220;this is great.&#8221; The folks at Google really push design as part a competitive advantage over Apple&#8217;s UI that was introduced with iOS 7. But after using it, it dawned on me that their was a major usability problem lurking inside.</p>
<h1>The Changes</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take a look at the structure and design of the old Google Maps and compare it to the new one. Google introduced new principles. These <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles" target="_blank">principles</a> that Google incorporated from their Material Design language are: material is a metaphor (a metaphor for paper and ink), bold, graphic, intentional (like print based design which focuses on typography and white space), and motion provides meaning (making animations that don&#8217;t disrupt but aid).</p>
<figure id="attachment_240" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_240" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-maps-ios-material-design.jpg"><img class="wp-image-240 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-maps-ios-material-design.jpg" alt="google-maps-ios-material-design" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_240" class="wp-caption-text">Before and after of Google Maps for iPhone</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Material Design documentation, Google handles primary actions with two main methods: &#8220;Floating Actions&#8221; and &#8220;Toolbars.&#8221; Now, starting navigation is something I would, and many others would consider a primary action. So I would expect it to be one of the two. But as you will find out, it&#8217;s neither.</p>
<h1>The Usability Problem</h1>
<p>As a user, the main thing I want to do when using a navigation app on my iPhone is to get to where I need to go, as soon as possible. This entails pressing the &#8220;start navigation&#8221; button. One problem: I could not find it. For the life of me. I stared at my phone for a good minute, trying to figure out where to tap to begin navigation. There was no floating button. There was no button in the toolbar. And I&#8217;m a UX Designer for crying out loud!</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only person to have this usability problem. The next day, I was in the car with my brother, only to discover he also could not find this call to action. Eventually, my brother figured it out. But the point of UX Design is to make things faster and easier to use.</p>
<p>It turns out that the way to start navigation is by tapping regular text, not a button. It completely gets lost in the list with all the other items.</p>
<figure id="attachment_242" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_242" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/material-design-iphone.jpg"><img class="wp-image-242 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/material-design-iphone.jpg" alt="material-design-iphone" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_242" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Start Navigation&#8221; is a primary action but doesn&#8217;t follow Google Material&#8217;s rules about primary actions </figcaption></figure>
<h1>My Point</h1>
<p>The point I am trying to make here centers around all the fact that no user interface has a perfect structure. The problem is UI/UX designers automatically make the assumption that what Google has is exactly what they should be doing. Just looking at the level of detail on Google&#8217;s Material Design website, even I am just amazed by the level of detail.</p>
<p>But understand that all user interfaces have flaws. Google&#8217;s Material is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but don&#8217;t feel like it steps on your what you are doing. Just because you don&#8217;t go into depth about animations velocity that you have an inferior design.</p>
<figure id="attachment_241" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_241" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-material-animation.jpg"><img class="wp-image-241 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-material-animation.jpg" alt="google-material-animation" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_241" class="wp-caption-text">A super in-depth page about animations in Material Design</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, everyone has their own UX and design methodology. For me, I always try to emulate the best, but my own creativity might be suffering if I do it too much. Solving problems that might even be better than what a Google designer can come up with. What do you think? Leave me a comment below and let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Twitter Bootstrap. How I adore you. You&#8217;re most popular framework in the world, and for good reason. Being the web design geek I am, I was so exited to see a recent post on Bootstrap&#8217;s official blog regarding Bootstrap 4. Slated for release it late December 2014, I gathered the top 5 most anticipated and confirmed features of Bootstrap version 4.</p>
<h1>1. Modified Grid System</h1>
<p>Bootstrap 3 has always had a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" target="_blank">rock solid grid system</a>. It makes designing responsive sites effortless. In Bootstrap 4, we shouldn&#8217;t be seeing a complete overhaul. According to the developers we will see at least one additional tier for handheld devices.</p>
<p><strong>Severity of change: Minor</strong></p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to learn. And it&#8217;s optional,  if you want to target a specific device size. If will probably require a simple appending of an extra class name. From least to greatest, it might be something like <code>col-lg-*</code> <code>col-md-*</code> <code>col-hd-*</code> <code>col-sm-*</code> and <code>col-xs-*</code>.</p>
<h1>2. Completely Redesigned Navbar</h1>
<p>Probably the hardest and most discouraging things about using Bootstrap 3 is the navbar. It&#8217;s tough to figure out. I mean there are so many class names to make it. Adding image as your logo is damn near impossible. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-brand-image" target="_blank">They tried to add this in Bootstrap 3.3</a>, but it&#8217;s too little too late for me.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have specific details about how the Navbar in Bootstrap 4 will behave on mobile. But hopefully it is less generic then <code>.navbar-collapse</code> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default" target="_blank">currently implemented today.</a> And maybe we will get some off-canvas navigation? Like the <a href="http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#offcanvas" target="_blank">Jasney Bootstrap</a> add-on pack provides?</p>
<p><strong><strong>Severity</strong> of change: Huge</strong></p>
<p>Odds are, you&#8217;ll have to restructure the HTML of your current navigation. But it will greatly reduce all those extra helper classes you&#8217;ve been adding trying to fix Boostrap 3&#8217;s navbar. Essentially, it&#8217;s totally worth it.</p>
<h1>3. Brand New Documentation</h1>
<p>The docs for Bootstrap have always been a bit clucky. For starters, sometimes I don&#8217;t know whether to look in the CSS section, or Javascript section. That side navigation bar is clucky (I always forget the back-to-top link).</p>
<p><strong><strong>Severity</strong> of change: Medium</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so the title says &#8220;Brand New&#8221; documentation. But that means brand new layout. Not necessarily content, which you are used to.</p>
<p>Check out a preview image of Bootstrap 4&#8217;s documentation I found on <a href="https://dribbble.com/mdo" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> from the creator of Bootstrap himself, <a href="http://markdotto.com/" target="_blank">Mark Otto</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_254" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_254" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bootstrap-4-docs.jpg"><img class="wp-image-254 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bootstrap-4-docs.jpg" alt="bootstrap-4-docs" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_254" class="wp-caption-text">Bootstrap 4 Docs preview posted by Mark Otto on his Dribbble account</figcaption></figure>
<h1>4. Animations and Transition on Components</h1>
<p>Bootstrap has never been very animation rich. I mean, yes, you do currently have animations for <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse" target="_blank">collapse accordions</a> and the like, but those really don&#8217;t provide gigantic wow factor. Looking at Google&#8217;s Material Design, it would only be natural for the most popular web component library to follow. Hmmm, I wonder if we might see some of <a href="http://daneden.me/" target="_blank">Daniel Eden&#8217;s</a> powerful <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">Animate CSS</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Severity</strong> of change: Medium</strong></p>
<p>Animations in Bootstrap 4 could indeed look really appealing, if users are not utilizing them wisely, they may be used all the time. Or used in the right context.</p>
<h1>5. A new approach to global theming</h1>
<p>This is most interesting to me. Currently, if you want to customize Bootstrap 3, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Override with a RAW CSS files (the hard way to do it)</li>
<li>Customize less files on Bootstrap&#8217;s <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/" target="_blank">customize page</a> (the hard way to do it)</li>
<li>Duplicate Bootstrap&#8217;s LESS variables file and override the original (the best way to do it)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder what they are going to do here? Maybe provide a special file completely focused on customizing colors, border-radius, etc?</p>
<p><strong><strong>Severity</strong> of change: Minor</strong></p>
<p>You are always going to be able to continue your normal workflow. So this change should have little impact if you  don’t care about having the folks at Twitter tell you how to make a theme.</p>
<h1>6. Bonus &#8211; All features</h1>
<p>We have to learn to trust the Twitter Bootstrap. Like I stated earlier, they are popular for good reason.  I&#8217;m always a bit worried about the ease of upgrading, but I&#8217;m sure that will be well thought.</p>
<p>Here is a complete list of what&#8217;s to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated grid system with at least one additional tier for handheld devices.</li>
<li>A brand new component to replace panels, thumbnails, and wells.</li>
<li>A completely new, simpler navbar.</li>
<li>Switch all pixel values over to rems and ems for easier and better type and component sizing.</li>
<li>Dropped support for IE8.</li>
<li>Tons of form updates, including custom form controls.</li>
<li>New component animations and transitions for several components.</li>
<li>UMD support throughout our JavaScript plugins.</li>
<li>Improved JavaScript positioning for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns.</li>
<li>Brand new documentation (written in Markdown, too!).</li>
<li>A new approach to configuring global theming options.</li>
<li>And hundreds more changes across the board.</li>
<li>Perhaps something with &#8220;stickers&#8221;? See pic below.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_255" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_255" class="wp-caption alignnone" ><a href="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bootstrap-4-stickers.jpg"><img class="wp-image-255 size-full img-full-responsive" src="http://iamkevinrhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bootstrap-4-stickers.jpg" alt="bootstrap-4-stickers" width="900" height="506" /></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_255" class="wp-caption-text">Bootstrap 4 &#8220;Stickers&#8221; posted by Mark Otto on his Dribbble account</figcaption></figure>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is always odd to me when you ask a designer if they have a personal website and they say &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;I used to but it&#8217;s old.&#8221; So back in 2010, I designed a website for myself. Partially because I didn&#8217;t want to be <em>that</em> designer who says they don&#8217;t have a site. Partially, because I had to make portfolio site for a class I was taking at San Diego State University. I produced a website that was good for the time. Fast forward four years later, and it is truly old and outdated. Here are the reasons why all designers should have their own website.</p>
<h1>You challenge Yourself</h1>
<p>So why not just use a theme? Photoshop templates are readily online. Take it a step further, and Bootstrap templates are available online. If time is an issue, then themes are fine. If you really want to learn new things, don&#8217;t rely on themes, you really have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>For my site, I set pretty high expectations. I wanted a filterable portfolio, Flickr feed, Instagram Feed, Twitter feed, fancy embellishments like Google Maps, and a blog! This meant I&#8217;d have to do a WordPress conversion when the design was done, adding another 2 months on to my time line. But I had this time to spare. I wasn&#8217;t in a rush.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>If you really want to learn new things, don&#8217;t rely on themes, you really have to do it yourself.</h1>
</blockquote>
<h1>You learn the latest web technologies</h1>
<p>In order to throughrouly learn technologies like HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and WordPress 4 (all of which I used for <a href="http://www.iamkevinrhodes.com" target="_blank">iamKevinRhodes.com</a>), you need to use them extensively. This was my way of &#8220;forcing&#8221; myself to learn.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a great way to learn new tools. I learned so much with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3</a>, <a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">Github for Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/" target="_blank">MAMP Pro</a>, and <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>. I also found that <a href="http://dploy.io/" target="_blank">dploy.io</a> is an awesome way to make your site go live with an FTP client like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>.</p>
<h1>You gather design resources</h1>
<p>I thoroughly explored websites like <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Wrapbootstrap</a> and <a href="http://themeforest.net/" target="_blank">Themeforest</a> and started cataloging all the great design sources I saw. For isntance, a theme might have awesome typogrpahy that I will use for a later project. I also got ideas from <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a>.</p>
<p>I took note of the resources by copying their links into a notebook I created in <a href="http://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank">OneNote</a> (just a  sidenote, I plan on creating a blog post in the near future on how I catalog design resources).</p>
<h1>You&#8217;ll be ready for that next job</h1>
<p>If you&#8217;re a designer looking for employment, a personal website is a must. But scrambling to build one after being laid off is no good. You should always be ready for anything life throws at you. Depending on the amount of time you have, you can just use a well designed theme. It doens&#8217;t have to be as extensive as mine.</p>
<h1>In Closing</h1>
<p>I hope I gave you some motivational reason why you should have your own site. I&#8217;m really proud of mine, and will be submitting it to Behance, <a href="http://onepagelove.com/" target="_blank">OnePageLove.com</a>, <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards.com</a>, <a href="http://builtwithbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">BuiltWithBootstrap.com</a>, and trying to get a Dribble invitation on <a href="http://draft.im/" target="_blank">Draft.im</a>.</p>
<p>It will be super assuring to be at a conference, or in a room with other designers and actively give out my web URL. What&#8217;s your motivation for creating your site? Let me know in the comments below.</p>
